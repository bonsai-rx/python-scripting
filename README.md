# Bonsai - Python Scripting

Bonsai.Scripting.Python is a [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) interface for the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. It uses [Python.NET](https://pythonnet.github.io/pythonnet/) under the hood to provide a seamless integration between the CPython runtime and data streaming in a Bonsai workflow.

You can use the Python Scripting package to run native Python scripts, import any module available to Python, and read or write to any variable in a named scope. The package is designed to work with any Python version from 3.7 onwards, and you can also use it in combination with [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to fully isolate your project dependencies.
